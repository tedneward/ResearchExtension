# ResearchExtension
A Chrome extension to "bookmark" pages into my R-and-D digital garden (github.com/tedneward/Research).

## Stories/Features/Epics

### Get the extension installed into Chrome and respond to clicks
In other words, a basic "Hello world" extension so I can get an iteration up and running ASAP.

### When I click the extension icon (browser-action), capture the title and URL of the active tab
For now, log it to the console

### When the extension fires up, do an HTTP request against GitHub/Research to get the list of directories (categories) under "content"
This is going to make it easier to select the categories a new item would go into

### When the extension fires up, do an HTTP requst against GitHub/Research to get the list of files under "tags"
Again, for easier UI when filling out a new bookmark/page

### When bookmarking a page, pop a dialog asking for the name of the new page, the category it goes in, and the tags to list
Maybe also ask for a summary? Fill in the "Website" or "Source" link text? Offer up a freeform text editor for some text to add?

### When bookmarking a page, offer up an option to choose an existing page and append the active tab link onto that page
Offer up a freeform text editor for some text to add?
