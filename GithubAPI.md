# GitHub REST API
Getting started: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api

Authentication basics: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest/guides/basics-of-authentication

Things I need to do with the API:
* authenticate against Research
    * personal token?
    * ask for password each time the extension loads?
* iterate over directory contents
    * content/ directories
    * each directory or subdirectory for file existence
* create file
* obtain contents of file and modify
* commit file and push
